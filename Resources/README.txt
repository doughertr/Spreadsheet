|		IMPORTANT NOTES			|
---------------------------------
External Code and Libraries:
  -	All code from previous projects has been brought into 
	this solution. Their project files and their test files
	are available inside the solution explorer. All of their
	.dll files are set to build into Resources/Libraries.
	all code references the .dll files in this location

Build Guidelines:
  -	The spreadsheet project is set as the one and only
	startup projects. The reset of the solutions are either
	class libraries or tests. The spreadsheetGUI project 
	depends on all of the other class library projects.
	The program must first build the .dll files from the 
	class libraries before the spreadsheet is executed

Extra Spreadsheet Features:
  -	Our project includes the ability to navigate between
	cells using the arrow keys. It also displays the current
	cell selected in the top left of the form.
  -	If more time was allowed, we would have implemented the
	ability to resize cell rows and columns. This feature
	was somewhat functional, but not working well enough
	to be implemented in the final submitted project
